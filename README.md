# 👋 Hi, I’m Ronel Solomon (@ronelsolomon)

I'm a **Data & ML Engineer** passionate about building scalable data platforms, automating ML pipelines, and enabling cross-functional teams through high-quality data solutions.

---

## 👀 I’m interested in:
- Scalable data engineering & real-time analytics platforms (Kafka, Flink)
- Generative AI, agentic/multi-agent systems, & LLM-powered workflows
- GenAI video generation (ComfyUI, AnimateDiff) & load-balanced AI video pipelines
- AI Engineering: Fine-tuning LLMs (Mistral, Llama) for production RAG/agents
- Medical AI agents & multimodal health diagnostics (e.g., audio-based detection)
- Secure, cloud-native ML infra (Azure, AWS, GCP) & open-source AI Ops tooling

## 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- Advanced MLOps & LLMOps: Production-grade model deployment on Kubernetes, CI/CD for ML (GitHub Actions, Argo, MLflow), observability (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry), and drift/quality monitoring at scale.
​- Fine-tuning & serving open-source LLMs: Instruction-tuning and RAG with Mistral/Llama, efficient finetuning (LoRA, QLoRA), vector databases, and latency-aware serving on GPUs/accelerators.
​- Real-time AI with streaming systems: End-to-end pipelines using Apache Kafka and Flink for low-latency feature stores, online inference, and feedback loops powering adaptive, real-time GenAI applications.


## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
- AI-powered education platforms: Textbook generation, adaptive tutoring agents, & LLM-driven personalized learning
​- ETL pipeline optimization & 2026 MLOps: Streaming (Kafka/Flink), scalable ML deployment, model monitoring at enterprise scale
- AI video generation pipelines: Load-balanced GenAI video workflows (ComfyUI, AnimateDiff, LTX-Video) for production-scale content
- Open-source agentic AI: Multi-agent systems, medical AI agents (HeAR audio diagnostics), LLM utilities for RAG/automation

## 🌟 Featured Projects:
 - AI-Powered Education Platform (MyEdMaster): Deployed LLM-based content personalization for 500+ users, boosting engagement via Python/TypeScript/AWS.
 ​- Slack Insight Bot (Metaphor Data): Built a vector search summarizer for 1K+ conversations, cutting retrieval time 30% with Hugging Face/MongoDB. 
 - HeAR Disease Detection: Achieved 80% accuracy in heart/lung audio diagnostics using PyTorch. Open to collaborations!

## ⚡ Fun fact:
Before diving into big data and machine learning, I built dashboards to detect fraud and optimize physical workspace security. I also love turning research papers into working prototypes for fun!
