# 👋 Hi, I’m Ronel Solomon (@ronelsolomon)

I'm a **Data & ML Engineer** passionate about building scalable data platforms, automating ML pipelines, and enabling cross-functional teams through high-quality data solutions.

## 👀 I’m interested in:
- Scalable data engineering and analytics platforms
- Generative AI, LLMs, and real-time NLP pipelines
- Secure, cloud-native ML infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Open-source contributions in data tooling and AI ops

## 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- Advanced MLOps with model deployment & monitoring at scale
- Fine-tuning open-source LLMs (e.g., Mistral, LLama) for real-world tasks
- Streaming data processing with Apache Kafka and Flink

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
- AI-powered education platforms (textbook generation, tutoring agents)
- ETL pipeline optimization & ML deployment projects
- Open-source LLM utilities and tools for analytics and automation

- 🖥️ [Portfolio (coming soon)](https://ronelsolomon.dev)

## ⚡ Fun fact:
Before diving into big data and machine learning, I built dashboards to detect fraud and optimize physical workspace security. I also love turning research papers into working prototypes for fun!
